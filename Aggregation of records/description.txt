the goal of these two techniques is to get a big set of values and somehow bring them down to a smaller set of values
Grouping:
1. Reduces many rows down to fewer rows.
2. Done by using the "Group by" keyword.
3. Visualizing the result is key to use.

Aggregate:
1. Reduces many values down to one.
2. Done by using "aggregate functions".
